building_ark_energy_well1: "Arc-XI S.H.A.F.T."
building_ark_energy_well1_desc: "A long time has passed since Project Horizon Arc was restarted by the newly formed United Government. S.H.A.F.T. XI is the first facility to officially go live. A massive amount of energy blasts the Skyveil continuously, opening a pathway to space. [root.owner.GetSpeciesName] is finally able to start exploring the mystries beyond the sky.\nUnfortunately, the exchange of information and materials between the planet and the outside world is severely restricted, as this is the only channel in and out."
building_ark_energy_well2: "Arc-XII S.H.A.F.T."
building_ark_energy_well2_desc: "An upgrade to the S.H.A.F.T. of Arc-XI . It can use energy more efficiently, and the channel formed on the Skyveil is now more stable. State-of-the-art laboratories are built around the entire facility, along with a magnificent art gallery for artists from far and wide. This symbolizes [root.owner.GetSpeciesName]'s first step towards conquering the sky."
building_ark_energy_well3: "Arc-XIV S.H.A.F.T."
building_ark_energy_well3_desc: "After the accident of Arc-XIII, the scientists successfully start anew. Arc-XIV S.H.A.F.T. rose from the ground. It has unparalleled energy efficiency and uses the same type of launcher as the Tachyon Lance."

building_ark_energy_well4b_desc: "The four majestic S.H.A.F.T.s of Arc-XIV, Arc-XV, Arc-XVI, and Arc-XVII all point directly up, creating 4 stable channels on the Skyveil. Although it is unknown who had the [root.owner.GetSpeciesName] trapped on the surface of this planet tens of thousands of years ago, the Skyveil we have now is the strongest protection for this civilization."
building_ark_energy_well5: "Decommissioned S.H.A.F.T. Array"
building_ark_energy_well5_desc: "As the light beam from Arc-XVII S.H.A.F.T. slowly dissipates, the four wells fall silent. Project Horizon Arc is finally concluded, but this pioneering project will forever be recorded in history. All [root.owner.GetSpeciesName] now live under the real sky.\nThese four Arc S.H.A.F.T.s will now be open to all populations as a permanent scientific and art facility."
